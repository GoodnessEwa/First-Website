            Gravitational mass refers to the amount of mass that an object has, which determines its gravitational attraction to other objects.

            Inertial mass, on the other hand, refers to the amount of mass that an object resists changes in its motion.
            According to the equivalence principle, these two types of mass are identical, meaning that any object that has gravitational mass also has inertial mass, and vice versa.This idea was first proposed by Albert Einstein as part of his theory of general relativity, and it has since been extensively tested and confirmed through various experiments and observations.In essence, the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass means that the way an object responds to gravity is the same way it responds to any other force that tries to change its motion.</p>

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularized in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
